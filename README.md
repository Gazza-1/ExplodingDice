# Exploding Dice

This implements exploding dice by adding another die of the specified type if the die result is the maximum for its type.

To do this, you will need to type in the dice formula (e.g 2D10 + 5) and click roll.

The dice roll will need to fit the format specified on the [knowledgebase](https://feedback.talespire.com/kb/article/talespire-url-scheme), with the exception of named roll, which is handled seperately, and multiple dice groups, which are not supported.
